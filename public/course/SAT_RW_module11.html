    choices: [
      "Bicycle infrastructure is popular with urban residents",
      "Cities that invested in bicycle infrastructure but saw no increase in actual bicycle usage still experienced similar decreases in traffic injuries, suggesting the infrastructure design itself — not just fewer cars — contributes to safety",
      "Several cities have recently announced plans to expand bicycle infrastructure",
      "Traffic injuries have been declining nationwide due to improved vehicle safety features"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The claim is that bike infrastructure DIRECTLY improves safety. An alternative explanation: maybe more bikes just means fewer cars, which means fewer injuries. B eliminates this alternative — even without more cyclists, the infrastructure itself reduced injuries (perhaps through slower traffic, better road design). This confirms a direct causal link."
