    choices: ["plausible", "improbable", "subtle", "deliberate"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `"Strained the reader's willingness to suspend disbelief" = the coincidences were hard to believe. "Improbable" means unlikely to happen. "Plausible" is the opposite.`

Reeves's research shows that remote workers log an average of 2.5 additional hours per day and report higher rates of burnout than their in-office counterparts.",
    stem: "Based on the texts, how would Reeves (Text 2) most likely respond to Park's argument?",
    choices: ["By agreeing that remote work improves work-life balance", "By arguing that the flexibility Park describes comes with hidden costs that undermine the benefits", "By proposing that all companies should return to in-office work", "By questioning Park's qualifications as a researcher"],
    answer: 1,

    choices: ["powerful", "glamorous", "controversial", "passive"],
    answer: 3,
    explain: '"Far from the ______ figure" contrasts with the real active Cleopatra (diplomat, commander, strategist). Popular culture often portrays her as decorative/romantic rather than active. "Passive" is what she was NOT — the passage corrects this misconception.'

    choices: ["nostalgia", "solemnity", "confusion", "simplicity"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: '17th-century religious language creates a serious, sacred tone. "Solemnity" means dignified seriousness. This contrasts with "mundane suburban settings." "Nostalgia" is about longing for the past, not gravitas.'

    passage: "Economist Raj Chetty's research has demonstrated that a child's zip code is among the strongest predictors of their future income — more predictive, in fact, than either parental education or individual test scores. This finding has been widely cited by advocates of place-based investment policies. Chetty himself, however, has cautioned against interpreting the data as evidence that geography alone determines outcomes, noting that the correlation reflects a complex web of institutional, social, and economic factors that happen to cluster geographically.",
    stem: "What is the function of the last sentence?",
    choices: ["It contradicts Chetty's original research findings", "It qualifies how Chetty's data should be interpreted, warning against an oversimplified conclusion", "It proposes an alternative explanation unrelated to geography", "It provides additional statistical evidence supporting the zip code finding"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `Chetty "cautioned against" oversimplification — the data is real but the interpretation shouldn't be simplistic. The sentence's function is to QUALIFY the finding against misuse.`

    choices: ["arrested", "bolstered", "undermined", "complicated"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `"Initially ______ confidence" BUT "eventually raised concerns" = the growth first built up confidence, then problems emerged. "Bolstered" means to strengthen or support. "Arrested" (stopped) is a trap secondary meaning that doesn't fit the contrast.`

    passage: "The assumption that ancient civilizations developed agriculture independently in response to similar environmental pressures has been challenged by geneticist Dr. Lydia Okafor. By analyzing DNA from 12,000-year-old grain samples across three continents, Okafor has shown that early domesticated crops share genetic markers suggesting a single origin point from which agricultural knowledge — and the crops themselves — were gradually disseminated through trade networks and migration.",
    stem: "What is the main purpose of this text?",
    choices: ["To describe the process by which ancient crops were genetically modified", "To present research that challenges the independent-origin model of agricultural development", "To argue that ancient trade networks were more extensive than previously believed", "To compare agricultural techniques across three continents"],

    passage: "Text 1:\nArt historian Dr. Miriam Jacobs argues that the primary value of public art lies in its capacity to provoke dialogue and challenge assumptions. The most successful public artworks, Jacobs contends, are those that generate debate — even heated controversy — because this engagement demonstrates that art is actively shaping public consciousness rather than merely decorating public spaces.\n\nText 2:\nUrban planner Carlos Mendez maintains that public art's value should be measured by its capacity to foster community cohesion rather than controversy. Mendez points to studies showing that murals, sculptures, and installations that reflect local identity and heritage strengthen residents' sense of belonging and correlate with reduced vandalism and increased civic participation.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the relationship between the two texts?",
    choices: ["Text 2 supports Text 1's argument with additional evidence", "Both texts agree that public art should be controversial", "The texts advocate for different criteria by which to evaluate public art's success", "Text 2 argues that public art has no meaningful social impact"],
    answer: 2,
    explain: "Jacobs measures success by dialogue/controversy. Mendez measures by community cohesion/belonging. Same subject (public art's value) but fundamentally different evaluation criteria."

    choices: ["brevity", "specificity", "objectivity", "urgency"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `"Naming specific officials," "detailing exact dates and decisions" = precise, detailed documentation. "Specificity" means the quality of being detailed and exact. "Objectivity" (neutrality) doesn't capture the detailed naming.`

    passage: "Text 1:\nPhysicist Dr. Amari contends that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence should focus primarily on detecting technological signatures — radio signals, laser pulses, or atmospheric pollutants that would indicate an industrialized civilization. These signatures, Amari argues, are the most detectable and the most unambiguous evidence of intelligent life.\n\nText 2:\nAstrobiologist Dr. Chen argues that Amari's approach suffers from anthropocentric bias — the assumption that alien civilizations would develop along technological pathways similar to humanity's. Chen advocates instead for a broader search framework that includes biosignatures (chemical indicators of any biological activity), arguing that limiting the search to technological markers risks overlooking the vast majority of life that may exist in non-technological forms.",
    stem: "Based on the texts, how does Chen's position relate to Amari's?",
    choices: ["Chen rejects the possibility of detecting extraterrestrial technology", "Chen supports Amari's approach but recommends additional funding", "Chen argues that Amari's framework is too narrow and proposes a more inclusive alternative", "Chen agrees with Amari on methods but disagrees on the likelihood of finding intelligent life"],
    answer: 2,
    explain: `Chen says Amari's approach is anthropocentric and "too narrow" — risks "overlooking the vast majority of life." Proposes broader framework. This is a challenge to scope with an alternative.`

    passage: "The decline of pollinator populations has been attributed to a constellation of factors: pesticide exposure, habitat loss, climate change, and disease. Of these, neonicotinoid pesticides have received the most public attention, largely due to several high-profile studies linking them to colony collapse in honeybees. Yet some entomologists argue that this focus on a single chemical class has obscured the more fundamental threat: the wholesale conversion of diverse ecosystems into agricultural monocultures that eliminate the varied floral resources pollinators need to survive.",
    stem: "What is the function of the last sentence?",
    choices: ["It dismisses pesticide exposure as irrelevant to pollinator decline", "It redirects attention from a widely discussed factor to what some scientists consider a more fundamental one", "It summarizes the previous sentences' main points", "It provides statistical evidence about monoculture farming"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `"Yet some argue this focus has obscured the more fundamental threat" — the sentence doesn't dismiss pesticides but REDIRECTS attention to habitat loss via monoculture. Function: refocusing the analysis.`

    choices: ["dishonest", "performative", "insufficient", "premature"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: '"Not because observers doubted her sincerity" eliminates "dishonest." The issue is it FELT like a performance — "carefully vetted, legally reviewed, crisis management." "Performative" means done for show, going through the motions. She may be sincere, but the format undermines it.'

    choices: ["overstate", "dismiss", "verify", "publicize"],
    answer: 0,
    explain: 'Small sample + limited scope + "broader claims premature" = they were careful not to exaggerate. "Overstate" means to express too strongly. The team showed appropriate intellectual humility about their findings.'

    passage: "Literary critic Amelia Thornton has proposed that the resurgence of interest in Octavia Butler's science fiction reflects not merely a belated recognition of Butler's literary merit but a broader cultural shift. In an era marked by climate anxiety, pandemic experience, and debates over systemic inequality, Thornton argues, Butler's speculative explorations of adaptation, community resilience, and power feel less like fiction and less like prophecy — and more like a practical framework for navigating an uncertain present.",
    stem: "What is the main purpose of this text?",
    choices: ["To provide a biography of science fiction writer Octavia Butler", "To argue that Butler's renewed popularity reflects contemporary cultural anxieties rather than purely literary reassessment", "To compare Butler's work with that of other science fiction writers", "To criticize the publishing industry for overlooking Butler's work"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: 'Thornton argues the resurgence reflects "a broader cultural shift" — climate, pandemic, inequality make Butler feel relevant NOW. Purpose: connecting literary revival to cultural moment.'

Torres argues that the CONTENT of screen engagement matters far more than duration — interactive educational programs and video calls with family members produce measurably different cognitive effects than passive consumption of entertainment content. Blanket time limits, Torres suggests, conflate fundamentally different activities under a single misleading metric.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the relationship between the two texts?",

    answer: 1,
    explain: `Torres says the debate "oversimplifies" and "conflates fundamentally different activities." The issue isn't WHETHER screens affect kids but that a blanket time-based approach ignores the crucial content variable.`

    choices: ["vibrant", "fragile", "original", "faded"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `"Extraordinary patience," "30-minute sessions," "single-hair brushes," "without disturbing" = the pigments are extremely delicate. "Fragile" captures why such extreme care is needed. "Original" and "faded" describe the pigments but don't explain the caution.`

By exposing students to diverse perspectives through literature, history, and philosophy, Nussbaum contends, universities cultivate the empathetic imagination and critical thinking skills that democratic self-governance requires. Without citizens capable of reasoning through complex moral and political questions, she warns, democracy degrades into mere majoritarianism.",
