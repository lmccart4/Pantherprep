      "The core concept is simple: every sentence must have clear boundaries. A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. Between sentences, you need proper punctuation — not just a comma.",

Dashes must come in pairs. The aside interrupts the main clause: 'The researchers...published their findings.'" },
  { passage: "The CEO announced three strategic priorities for the coming fiscal year ______ expanding into Southeast Asian markets, reducing operational costs by 15%, and launching a direct-to-consumer platform.", choices: ["year,", "year:", "year;", "year —"], answer: 1, diff: "hard", subtype: "Colon", explain: "The list specifies the 'three strategic priorities.' A colon correctly introduces a specifying list after an independent clause. An em-dash would also work, but the colon is the standard choice." },
  { passage: "Although the archaeological evidence strongly suggested that the settlement had been continuously inhabited for over three millennia ______ the lead researcher cautioned that carbon dating alone could not confirm such a claim with absolute certainty.", choices: ["millennia;", "millennia:", "millennia,", "millennia."], answer: 2, diff: "hard", subtype: "Fragment", explain: "'Although...millennia' is a dependent clause. Only a comma correctly attaches it to the independent clause. Semicolon, colon, and period would all create a fragment on the left." },
  { passage: "The composer's final symphony was performed posthumously in Vienna in 1828 ______ it was not until the late twentieth century that scholars recognized it as one of the most innovative works of the Romantic period.", choices: ["1828,", "1828;", "1828:", "1828"], answer: 1, diff: "hard", subtype: "Semicolon", explain: "Two independent clauses. The semicolon correctly joins them. Comma = splice. Colon doesn't fit because the second clause doesn't explain the first — it adds contrasting information about a different time period." },
  { passage: "The new trade agreement, which was negotiated over eighteen months by representatives from twelve ______ is expected to reduce tariffs on agricultural exports by an average of 23%.", choices: ["nations —", "nations;", "nations,", "nations:"], answer: 2, diff: "hard", subtype: "Fragment", explain: "'Which was negotiated...nations' is a nonrestrictive clause set off by commas. The comma after 'nations' closes this clause, returning to the main sentence: 'The new trade agreement...is expected.' A dash would require a matching opening dash (there isn't one). Semicolon/colon would break the sentence." },
  { passage: "The evidence was ______ even the defense attorney acknowledged that her client's alibi had significant inconsistencies.", choices: ["overwhelming,", "overwhelming;", "overwhelming:", "overwhelming, so"], answer: 2, diff: "hard", subtype: "Colon", explain: "The second clause explains HOW overwhelming the evidence was. A colon signals this explanatory relationship. Comma = splice. Semicolon works grammatically but misses the causal relationship. 'So' would also work but the colon is stronger." }
