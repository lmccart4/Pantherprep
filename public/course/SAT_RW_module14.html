Read carefully but efficiently.\n\nSLOW QUESTIONS (90-120 seconds): Inference, strengthen/weaken, data interpretation, synthesis. These reward careful analysis.",

    answer: 1,
    explain: 'The claim is about loss aversion in switching. B provides a direct demonstration: people require $200 in savings (2x the actual $100 benefit) before switching — exactly matching the "twice as strongly" loss aversion ratio. Specific, quantitative, and directly on-claim.'

    answer: 1,

For over two hundred years, this postage-stamp-sized outpost served as Japan's sole window to Western science, medicine, and technology — with Japanese scholars, known as rangaku practitioners, painstakingly translating Dutch texts on anatomy, astronomy, and chemistry.",

  { id: "c1", type: "strengthen", passage: "Economists studying the gig economy found that workers on platform-based jobs (ride-sharing, food delivery) earn an average hourly wage that appears competitive with traditional employment. However, after accounting for vehicle depreciation, fuel, insurance, self-employment taxes, and unpaid waiting time between jobs, researchers hypothesized that effective hourly compensation drops below minimum wage for the majority of gig workers.", stem: "Which finding would most strengthen this hypothesis?", choices: ["Some gig workers enjoy flexible scheduling", "A comprehensive analysis of 40,000 ride-share drivers' tax returns revealed that 74% earned less than their state's minimum wage after deducting IRS-standard vehicle costs and self-employment taxes, with median effective pay of $6.20 per hour including idle time", "Gig economy companies have grown rapidly in recent years", "Traditional employment offers benefits like health insurance"], answer: 1, explain: "The hypothesis claims that after costs, most gig workers earn below minimum wage. B provides comprehensive data (40,000 tax returns) showing exactly this: 74% below minimum wage, with a specific effective rate ($6.20/hr). The scale and specificity make this the strongest support." },
  { id: "c2", type: "weaken", passage: "A popular theory in education suggests that matching instruction to students' preferred 'learning styles' (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) improves academic outcomes. Many schools have invested heavily in learning-style assessments and differentiated instruction based on these categorizations.", stem: "Which finding would most weaken this theory?", choices: ["Students have different preferences for how they receive information", "A meta-analysis of 29 controlled experiments found no significant difference in learning outcomes when instruction matched students' self-reported learning styles versus when it deliberately mismatched them \u2014 but did find that certain teaching methods were universally more effective regardless of student preference", "Some teachers find it difficult to differentiate instruction", "Learning style assessments are commercially available"], answer: 1, explain: "The theory predicts that matching styles to instruction improves outcomes. B directly refutes this: controlled experiments show NO benefit to matching, and universal methods work better. This eliminates both the match benefit and the premise that styles matter for instruction." },

C provides the critical missing link: the site predates farming by 1,000+ years, which is what forced the reconsideration. 'Because' introduces the causal reason. A/D don't fit logically. B implies contrast but this is cause-effect." },
  { id: "c4", type: "inference", passage: "When neuroscientist Paul MacLean proposed his 'triune brain' model in the 1960s \u2014 suggesting the human brain consists of three evolutionary layers (reptilian, limbic, neocortex) stacked atop one another \u2014 it offered an elegant explanation for why emotions sometimes override rational thought. The model remains widely taught in psychology courses and popular science books. However, modern neuroimaging studies have shown that brain regions MacLean assigned to different evolutionary 'layers' are in fact densely interconnected, with the 'reptilian' brainstem participating in complex cognitive tasks and the 'rational' neocortex deeply involved in emotional processing.", stem: "Which inference is best supported by the text?", choices: ["Paul MacLean was not a qualified neuroscientist", "The triune brain model, while intuitively appealing, oversimplifies brain organization by suggesting a strict functional hierarchy that modern neuroscience has shown does not exist", "Emotions are always more powerful than rational thought", "Brain imaging technology is unreliable"], answer: 1, explain: "The passage says the model was 'elegant' (intuitive) but modern evidence shows regions are 'densely interconnected' across supposed layers. B captures both: the model oversimplifies by suggesting strict hierarchy that doesn't exist. A attacks the person (unsupported). C/D are unsupported." },

Which choice most effectively achieves this goal?", choices: ["The American chestnut was once a common tree in Eastern forests, but a fungal blight killed many of them.", "The American Chestnut Foundation has been working to develop blight-resistant trees through breeding programs.", "The near-total destruction of 3.5 billion American chestnuts by an imported fungus ranks among the worst ecological disasters in North American history, yet decades of painstaking backcross breeding have now produced trees that carry the chestnut's genetic heritage with a borrowed resistance \u2014 offering the possibility that a species once given up for dead may reclaim its place in Eastern forests.", "Japanese chestnut nursery stock accidentally carried a fungal blight to New York in 1904."], answer: 2, explain: "The goal requires BOTH catastrophic loss AND scientific hope. C delivers both with scale (3.5 billion, 'worst ecological disasters') and hope ('borrowed resistance,' 'reclaim its place'). The contrast structure perfectly matches the requested framing. A is too mild. B/D cover only one half." },

'Ambiguous' means open to multiple interpretations, which perfectly matches intentional vagueness used diplomatically. 'Meticulous' means precise (opposite). 'Provocative' means inflammatory. 'Redundant' means repetitive." }
