    passage: "Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have identified a gene variant carried by roughly 20% of the population that appears to confer a higher tolerance for pain. Individuals with this variant produce elevated levels of a naturally occurring opioid-like compound in the brain, effectively raising their pain threshold. The discovery may explain why pain perception varies so dramatically between individuals and could eventually inform the development of non-addictive pain medications modeled on the body's own chemistry.",

    passage: "The traditional model of scientific discovery — a lone genius experiencing a sudden eureka moment — has been largely debunked by historians of science. Studies of major breakthroughs consistently reveal that innovation emerges from collaborative networks, incremental advances, and the cross-pollination of ideas across disciplines. Even discoveries attributed to individual scientists, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, were shaped by decades of correspondence, debate, and collective knowledge-building within scientific communities.",

    passage: "When Pixar Animation Studios was struggling in its early years, Steve Jobs considered selling it on multiple occasions. The company's first purely commercial product — a high-end graphics computer called the Pixar Image Computer — sold poorly, and the company lost money every year for its first decade. It was only when the team pivoted fully to animated storytelling, releasing Toy Story in 1995, that Pixar became profitable. Jobs later described keeping Pixar alive during those lean years as 'the best decision I ever made — and the luckiest.'",

The district superintendent cited this as evidence that chess improves mathematical reasoning and proposed expanding the chess program to all schools.",
    stem: "Which finding, if true, would most weaken the superintendent's conclusion?",
    choices: ["Chess is a complex strategic game that requires analytical thinking", "Students who joined chess club had scored 16% higher on math tests BEFORE joining the club, suggesting that pre-existing mathematical aptitude attracted students to chess rather than chess improving math skills", "Some students in chess club also participated in other extracurricular activities", "The chess program was led by a popular and engaging teacher"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "If chess students already scored 16% higher BEFORE joining, the 18% gap is almost entirely pre-existing. This is classic REVERSE CAUSATION: math talent → chess interest, not chess → math improvement. Only a 2% difference remains after accounting for pre-existing ability."

    stem: "A school board member argues that reducing class sizes to 15-18 students would dramatically improve student outcomes enough to justify the increased cost. Does the data support this claim?",
    choices: ["Yes, because smaller classes always produce better results", "The data shows a consistent but modest association between smaller classes and higher scores — roughly 3 points per tier reduction — suggesting meaningful but not dramatic improvement. Whether the $6,000 per-student cost increase justifies a 9-point gain requires a value judgment the data alone cannot make", "No, because the test score differences are too small to measure", "Yes, because teacher satisfaction is much higher in smaller classes"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "Scores improve ~3 points per size reduction (78→81→84→87). Cost increases from $8,200 to $14,200 (+$6,000). B accurately describes the trade-off: real but modest improvement, with the cost-benefit judgment being a policy question, not a data question."

    passage: "The widespread assumption that creativity is primarily a right-brain function has been thoroughly undermined by neuroimaging research. Studies using fMRI consistently show that creative tasks — whether composing music, writing poetry, or solving novel problems — activate distributed networks spanning BOTH hemispheres, with the degree of inter-hemispheric communication being a stronger predictor of creative output than activation in any single region. Neuroscientist Dr. Beaty's research suggests that creativity depends not on one side of the brain but on the brain's ability to dynamically integrate multiple, often competing, neural networks.",

Dr. Navarro attributed this difference to the absence of neonicotinoid pesticides on organic farms.\n\nHowever, Dr. Navarro also noted that organic farms in the study had significantly more diverse crop plantings (averaging 12 crop varieties versus 3 for conventional farms) and maintained unplowed hedgerows and wildflower margins that conventional farms lacked.",
    stem: "Taken together, what do these findings most strongly suggest?",
    choices: ["Neonicotinoid pesticides are the sole cause of bee population decline", "While pesticide absence may contribute to larger bee populations near organic farms, the greater habitat diversity — varied crops and preserved wild margins — represents a confounding variable that makes it impossible to attribute the difference solely to pesticide use", "Organic farming is always better for the environment than conventional farming", "Bee populations are increasing worldwide due to organic farming"],
    answer: 1,

Despite this dramatic evidence, Semmelweis's findings were rejected by the medical establishment, which considered the suggestion that doctors' hands could transmit disease to be insulting to the profession. Semmelweis was dismissed from his hospital position and eventually committed to a mental institution, where he died at age 47.

    answer: 1,

    passage: "Philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah has argued that identity categories — race, nationality, religion — are not fixed, natural kinds but 'labels' that gain meaning through social practice and that can be contested, revised, or abandoned as societies change. This does not mean identities are unreal or unimportant, Appiah emphasizes; rather, understanding their constructed nature is precisely what allows marginalized groups to challenge the definitions imposed on them and assert new ones. The danger, he suggests, lies not in having identities but in treating them as though they were eternal and unchangeable — a mistake that empowers those who would use identity to exclude rather than include.",
    stem: "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    choices: ["Appiah believes that all identity categories should be abolished", "Understanding identities as socially constructed rather than fixed is empowering because it reveals that definitions can be challenged and revised, particularly by those who have been marginalized", "Identity categories are unimportant in modern society", "Appiah argues that race is the most important identity category"],

The same study found that listening to non-preferred genres produced only a 12% increase.\n\nA separate psychology study found that workers who listened to self-selected music while performing repetitive tasks completed 31% more units and reported 40% higher job satisfaction than workers in silent conditions. However, workers who listened to researcher-selected music showed no productivity benefit and reported the experience as distracting.",

    answer: 1,
    explain: "Study 1: preferred music → strong reward response, non-preferred → weak response. Study 2: self-selected → productivity gains, researcher-selected → no benefit. SYNTHESIS: the CHOICE/preference is the key variable, not music itself. B combines both findings around this insight."

Given that the galaxy contains approximately 100 billion sun-like stars, this means there are roughly 70 billion potentially habitable worlds in our galaxy alone.

    answer: 1,

    passage: "In the 1960s, psychologist Walter Mischel conducted the famous 'marshmallow test,' in which preschoolers were offered one marshmallow immediately or two if they waited fifteen minutes. Follow-up studies found that children who waited scored higher on SATs and had better life outcomes decades later. The study was widely cited as proof that self-control is a key predictor of success. However, a 2018 replication with a larger, more diverse sample found that the correlation between waiting and later outcomes largely disappeared once researchers controlled for family socioeconomic status. Children from wealthier families were more likely both to wait (having learned that promised rewards typically materialize) and to have better outcomes (due to the advantages wealth provides).",
