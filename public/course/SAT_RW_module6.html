The passage describes intellectual rigor, not distrust of people. Answer: skeptical.',

  { passage:"The artist's decision to destroy her early paintings was not impulsive; rather, it reflected a ______ choice to distance herself from work she considered derivative.", wordA:"deliberate", wordB:"calculated", correct:"A", explainA:'"Deliberate" means done consciously and intentionally after careful thought.

  { passage:"Rather than impose a solution, the mediator adopted a ______ approach, guiding the disputing parties toward their own resolution through carefully structured dialogue.", wordA:"patient", wordB:"facilitative", correct:"B", explainA:'"Patient" means tolerant of delay — a personal quality, not a methodology.', explainB:'"Facilitative" means designed to make a process easier.
