    passage: "For decades, the prevailing theory held that the extinction of large Ice Age mammals — mammoths, giant sloths, saber-toothed cats — was driven primarily by human hunting. However, a 2023 study analyzing fossilized pollen and sediment layers across North America revealed that many of these species had already begun declining centuries before humans arrived on the continent. The researchers argue that rapid climate shifts at the end of the Pleistocene disrupted the ecosystems these animals depended on, and that human hunting, while a contributing factor, merely accelerated an extinction process already underway.",

      "Human hunting was the sole cause of Ice Age mammal extinctions",
      "A study suggests that climate change, not just human hunting, played a primary role in Ice Age extinctions",

Her mosaic-like compositions, inspired by the view of flowers and trees from her Washington, D.C., window, employed bold bands of color that anticipated developments in Color Field painting. Though she received significant recognition in her final years, including becoming the first African American woman to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum, Thomas's contributions to American abstraction remained largely overlooked by art historians until a major reassessment began in the 2010s.",

But it is the animal's cognitive abilities that have most surprised researchers. Octopuses can solve complex puzzles, navigate mazes, and distinguish individual human faces — capabilities previously thought to require the kind of centralized brain structure that octopuses lack. Instead, roughly two-thirds of an octopus's neurons are distributed throughout its eight arms, each of which can act semi-independently. This decentralized nervous system challenges fundamental assumptions about the relationship between brain structure and intelligence.",

These roads succeeded in opening previously inaccessible regions to farming and mining but also triggered a pattern of deforestation that has since destroyed roughly 17% of the original forest cover. A 2022 study found that deforested areas near roads experienced not only biodiversity loss but also significant changes in local rainfall patterns, suggesting that the ecological consequences of road construction extend far beyond the immediate footprint of the roads themselves.",

Subsequent research, however, has substantially revised this estimate downward. Psychologist Nelson Cowan's influential 2001 review concluded that the true capacity is closer to four items, and that Miller's higher estimate reflected participants' use of 'chunking' — the unconscious grouping of individual items into larger meaningful units. A phone number like 8005551234, for instance, is ten digits but can be chunked into three groups (800-555-1234), effectively reducing the memory load.",

    passage: "A 2024 study of 12,000 scientific papers found that research conducted by teams spanning multiple institutions and countries was cited 45% more frequently than single-institution studies, even after controlling for factors such as journal prestige, author reputation, and research funding levels. The citation advantage was most pronounced in interdisciplinary fields and least pronounced in highly specialized subfields where a single laboratory might possess all necessary expertise.",

    passage: "We were the last to leave the lake that summer, my father and I. The other cabins had shuttered their windows weeks before, their docks pulled ashore like beached canoes. But my father kept finding reasons to stay — a fence that needed mending, a shutter that had come loose, the northern pike that he swore was getting bigger each day and would certainly take his lure tomorrow. I was twelve and understood none of this. I understand now that he was not fixing fences. He was holding the door open against something that was coming, something that had already arrived in the careful way my mother folded her clothes into suitcases back in the city.",

    answer: 1,
    explain: `"Holding the door open against something that was coming" + "already arrived" + mother "folding clothes into suitcases" (suggesting departure/separation) = the father was avoiding the end of the marriage. The narrator says they didn't understand at 12 but understands now.`

    passage: "The discovery that certain gut bacteria can metabolize the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus has forced a fundamental reconsideration of how medications are dosed. Transplant patients who harbor high levels of the bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii require significantly higher doses of tacrolimus to achieve therapeutic blood levels — in some cases, up to three times the standard dose. Gastroenterologist Dr. Nasir Malik proposes that routine gut microbiome profiling before transplant surgery could allow physicians to personalize drug dosages based on each patient's bacterial composition, potentially reducing both drug toxicity from overdosing and organ rejection from underdosing.",

    explain: "Bacteria affect drug metabolism → patients need different doses → proposal for personalized dosing based on microbiome. B captures the central argument: bacteria-drug interaction necessitates personalized approaches."
