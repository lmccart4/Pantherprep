    answer: 1,
    explain: "The proposal: sleep deprivation → impaired waste clearance → toxic protein accumulation → Alzheimer's risk. B provides direct evidence of the proposed mechanism: sleep-deprived people have MORE toxic proteins, proportional to sleep loss severity. This is exactly what the glymphatic theory predicts."

He developed severe gastritis within days, then cured himself with antibiotics — proving his theory and eventually winning the Nobel Prize in 2005. Before Marshall's self-experiment, ulcer patients had been told for decades to reduce stress and avoid spicy food, treatments that managed symptoms but never addressed the actual cause.",
