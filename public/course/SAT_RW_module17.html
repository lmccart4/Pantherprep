    choices: ["estimated,", "estimated;", "estimated:", "estimated"],
    answer: 0,
    explain: '"The geologists discovered that the cave system extended much farther than previously estimated" is a complete main clause. What follows ("with passages stretching...") is a participial phrase modifying the main clause. A comma correctly separates the clause from the modifying phrase.'

    choices: ["aggressive", "incremental", "haphazard", "dogmatic"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: '"Small agreements, gradually" = step-by-step. "Incremental" means happening in small, gradual stages. "Aggressive" contradicts the patience. "Haphazard" means random. "Dogmatic" means rigidly ideological.'

    type: "purpose",
    passage: "For decades, art historians dismissed the paintings of Artemisia Gentileschi as derivative of her father Orazio's work, attributing her most powerful canvases to him or to unnamed male collaborators. It was not until feminist scholars in the 1970s undertook a systematic reexamination of her oeuvre — matching brushwork analysis, pigment composition, and archival records of commissions — that Gentileschi emerged as one of the most technically accomplished painters of the Italian Baroque, whose innovations in depicting dramatic intensity and female agency had no precedent in the work of her father or contemporaries.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
    choices: ["To argue that Orazio Gentileschi was a lesser artist than his daughter", "To describe how scholarly reexamination overturned decades of misattribution and revealed Artemisia Gentileschi's originality", "To explain techniques used in Italian Baroque painting", "To criticize feminist scholarship in art history"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The passage moves from: dismissed/misattributed → reexamination with evidence → revealed as original and innovative. The purpose is how scholarly reexamination corrected a historical error."

    passage: "The widespread belief that goldfish have a three-second memory is entirely false. Studies have consistently demonstrated that goldfish can remember information for months. In one experiment, researchers trained goldfish to push a lever for food; the fish remembered the correct lever five months later. This finding is part of a broader body of research showing that many animals commonly assumed to lack cognitive abilities possess far more sophisticated mental capacities than popular culture suggests.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?",
    choices: ["It introduces a new topic unrelated to goldfish memory", "It provides a specific experimental example that supports the claim made in the second sentence", "It contradicts the findings described in the second sentence", "It transitions to a discussion of human memory"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "Sentence 2: goldfish remember for months (general claim). Sentence 3: experiment with lever, remembered 5 months later (specific example). The third sentence provides concrete experimental evidence supporting the general claim."

    passage: "Text 1:\nEconomist Dr. Petrov argues that universal basic income (UBI) would reduce poverty without discouraging work. He cites a Finnish pilot program in which 2,000 unemployed citizens received monthly payments; participants were no less likely to seek employment than a control group, and reported significantly lower stress and higher well-being.\n\nText 2:\nEconomist Dr. Tanaka cautions against generalizing from small pilot programs to national policy. She notes that the Finnish study's 2,000 participants knew the program was temporary and that being observed might have influenced their behavior. A permanent, universal program, Tanaka argues, could produce very different labor market effects than a short-term experiment with a small, self-aware sample.",
    stem: "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Tanaka most likely respond to Dr. Petrov's use of the Finnish study?",
    choices: ["By agreeing that the Finnish study conclusively proves UBI works", "By arguing that UBI would definitely discourage work", "By contending that the study's small scale, temporary nature, and observation effects limit its applicability to permanent national policy", "By suggesting that Finland's economy is too different from other countries for the study to be relevant"],
    answer: 2,
    explain: "Tanaka's objections are specific: small sample, temporary program, observation effects. She doesn't reject UBI entirely — she questions whether THIS evidence can justify NATIONAL policy. C captures her methodological concerns."

    type: "purpose",
    passage: "The octopus, despite being an invertebrate with no backbone and a lifespan rarely exceeding two years, demonstrates problem-solving abilities that rival those of some primates. In laboratory settings, octopuses have unscrewed jars from the inside to escape, navigated complex mazes using spatial memory, and even used coconut shells as portable shelters — a behavior that meets the scientific definition of tool use. These cognitive feats challenge the long-held assumption that complex intelligence requires a vertebrate brain.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
    choices: ["To compare octopuses to primates in detail", "To present evidence that octopus intelligence challenges assumptions about the biological requirements for complex cognition", "To describe the daily behavior of octopuses in the wild", "To argue that invertebrates are smarter than vertebrates"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: 'The passage presents specific cognitive feats (jars, mazes, tools) and concludes they "challenge the long-held assumption." The purpose is to use octopus evidence to question what biology intelligence requires.'
  },
  // BLOCK 4: INFORMATION & IDEAS (Q14-20)
  {
    id: 14,
    type: "central",
    passage: "Scientists have long known that trees in forests communicate through underground fungal networks, nicknamed the 'Wood Wide Web,' sharing nutrients and chemical warning signals. New research reveals a more complex picture: these networks are not purely cooperative. Dominant trees can monopolize network resources, and fungi sometimes act as parasites rather than mutualists, extracting more carbon from trees than they return in nutrients. The emerging view is that forest networks, like human economies, involve a dynamic mix of cooperation, competition, and exploitation.",
    stem: "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    choices: ["Forest fungal networks are purely cooperative systems that benefit all trees equally", "Underground fungal networks in forests involve not just cooperation but also competition and exploitation, resembling complex economic systems", "Fungi are parasites that harm trees through underground networks", "Scientists do not understand how trees communicate"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The passage moves from the cooperative view → complication (not purely cooperative, also competition/exploitation) → conclusion (dynamic mix like economies). B captures the full complexity."
  },

    id: 15,
    type: "detail",
    passage: "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494 between Spain and Portugal, divided the newly discovered lands of the Americas along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Lands east of the line would belong to Portugal; lands west to Spain. This arbitrary division, ratified by Pope Alexander VI, is the reason Brazil — which juts eastward into the Atlantic — became a Portuguese-speaking nation while virtually every other country in South and Central America speaks Spanish.",
    stem: "According to the passage, what explains why Brazil speaks Portuguese while most of South America speaks Spanish?",
    choices: ["Brazil was colonized before the rest of South America", "The Treaty of Tordesillas placed Brazil east of the dividing line, assigning it to Portugal's sphere while the rest of the Americas fell under Spain's", "Portuguese explorers were more skilled navigators than Spanish explorers", "The Pope declared that Brazil should speak Portuguese"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The passage explicitly states: the meridian line placed lands east (Brazil juts east) under Portugal and lands west under Spain. B matches this detail directly."

    type: "inference",
    passage: "In 2019, the Japanese art collective teamLab opened a permanent museum in Tokyo consisting entirely of digital art installations — no physical artworks, no frames, no traditional gallery spaces. Within its first year, the museum attracted 2.3 million visitors, making it the single most visited institution dedicated to a single artist or collective in the world. Notably, the museum's visitor demographics skewed dramatically younger than those of traditional art museums, with 68% of visitors under 35.",
    stem: "Which inference is best supported by the text?",
    choices: ["Digital art is objectively superior to traditional art", "Traditional art museums may need to reconsider their approach if they wish to engage younger audiences, as the teamLab museum's success suggests that immersive, technology-driven experiences appeal to demographics that conventional galleries are not reaching", "Physical art museums will close within the next decade", "All art should be digital"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "Most visited + 68% under 35 + dramatically different from traditional museum demographics = digital/immersive experiences attract young audiences that traditional galleries miss. B draws this inference without overgeneralizing."

    answer: 1,
    explain: "Depression drops sharply from 14.2→11.8→9.1 (big drops) then barely changes 9.1→8.9. Same pattern for anxiety and well-being. B correctly identifies: consistent association, diminishing returns at high levels, biggest gains in the lower-to-middle range."

    passage: "Psychologist Dr. Okafor argues that the concept of 'grit' — persistence and passion for long-term goals — is overstated as a predictor of success. She contends that structural advantages such as wealth, social connections, and educational access play a far larger role than individual character traits.",
    claim: "Dr. Okafor argues that grit's importance is overstated because structural factors are more predictive of success.",

    choices: ["Many successful people describe themselves as hardworking and persistent", "A longitudinal study found that students' socioeconomic status predicted college completion rates five times more strongly than their grit scores, and that among students with equal grit levels, those from wealthy families were three times more likely to graduate than those from low-income families", "Grit can be measured using validated psychological scales", "Dr. Okafor has studied success factors for over fifteen years"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The claim: structure > grit. B provides direct comparative evidence: SES predicted success 5x more than grit, and equal grit + different wealth = 3x different outcomes. This shows grit alone doesn't overcome structural barriers."

    passage: "A study found that residents of walkable neighborhoods weigh an average of 8 pounds less than residents of car-dependent suburbs. The researchers concluded that neighborhood walkability directly promotes healthier body weight through increased physical activity.",

    choices: ["Walkable neighborhoods often have better access to public transit", "Residents of walkable neighborhoods also had significantly higher incomes and education levels, and were more likely to have chosen their neighborhood specifically because of existing health-conscious lifestyles — suggesting self-selection rather than neighborhood influence", "Walking is a beneficial form of exercise", "The study included over 10,000 participants"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The conclusion claims walkability CAUSES lower weight. B reveals self-selection: health-conscious people CHOOSE walkable neighborhoods. The weight difference may reflect pre-existing health behaviors and socioeconomic advantages, not the neighborhood's influence on behavior."

    answer: 1,
    explain: `No bilingual key + extremely short texts = insufficient data for decipherment. B is the logical conclusion: we need either longer texts or a bilingual key (like the Rosetta Stone was for hieroglyphics). A overstates ("no linguistic meaning" is unproven). C and D aren't supported.`
