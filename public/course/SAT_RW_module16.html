    choices: ["undertaken in the Caribbean,", "undertaken, in the Caribbean", "undertaken in the Caribbean;", "undertaken in the Caribbean"],
    answer: 0,
    explain: 'The clause "which marine biologists...Caribbean" is a nonrestrictive parenthetical. It needs a comma to close the clause before returning to the main sentence ("has already shown"). A correctly closes the clause with a comma.'

    choices: ["lucid", "obscure", "verbose", "arcane"],
    answer: 0,
    explain: '"Clear, conversational language" + "accessible" = transparent, easy to understand. "Lucid" means clear and easy to understand. "Obscure" and "arcane" mean the opposite. "Verbose" means wordy.'

    choices: ["reckless", "ambiguous", "transparent", "impulsive"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: '"Refusing to commit" + "preserved flexibility" = intentionally unclear. "Ambiguous" means open to multiple interpretations. The key word is "deliberately" — this was strategic vagueness, not accidental.'
  },
  {
    id: 8,

    stem: "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word?",
    choices: ["enhanced", "diminished", "embellished", "replicated"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: '"Neglect and seismic activity" are destructive forces, BUT the grandeur still shows through. "Diminished" = made smaller/lesser. The ruins are damaged but still impressive. "Enhanced" and "embellished" suggest improvement.'

    id: 10,
    type: "purpose",
    passage: "While popular accounts often describe the mantis shrimp's remarkable color vision — with 16 types of photoreceptors compared to humans' three — as evidence of a richer visual experience, marine biologist Dr. Thoen's research suggests a more nuanced picture. The shrimp's visual system appears optimized not for color discrimination but for rapid color recognition, allowing instant identification of prey and predators without the neural processing time that human-style color analysis requires.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
    choices: ["To argue that mantis shrimp have poor vision", "To complicate a popular assumption about mantis shrimp vision by presenting research suggesting their visual system serves a different function than commonly believed", "To compare human and mantis shrimp intelligence", "To describe the habitat of the mantis shrimp"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `"While popular accounts..." sets up the common view, then "more nuanced picture" signals a complication. The passage doesn't say the vision is worse — it serves a DIFFERENT function (rapid recognition vs. rich experience). B captures this nuance.`

    id: 11,
    type: "function",
    passage: "Economists have long debated whether raising the minimum wage increases unemployment. A 2023 meta-analysis of 50 years of research found no consistent evidence that moderate increases cause significant job losses. However, the study's authors cautioned that their findings apply only to increases of 10-15% above current levels; the effects of substantially larger increases remain poorly understood.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the function of the last sentence in the overall structure of the text?",
    choices: ["It contradicts the findings of the meta-analysis", "It qualifies the study's conclusion by specifying the scope within which it applies", "It introduces a completely new topic unrelated to minimum wage", "It provides additional evidence supporting the meta-analysis"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `The last sentence doesn't contradict — it LIMITS the scope. "Only to increases of 10-15%" and "substantially larger increases remain poorly understood" = the conclusion is valid but bounded. B captures this qualifying function.`

    id: 12,
    type: "crosstext",
    passage: "Text 1:\nArchaeologist Dr. Yamamoto argues that the collapse of the Maya civilization was triggered primarily by prolonged drought, citing paleoclimate data showing a series of severe dry periods between 800-1000 CE that would have devastated the agricultural systems sustaining Maya cities.\n\nText 2:\nWhile acknowledging the role of drought, historian Dr. Reyes contends that environmental stress alone cannot explain the Maya collapse. Reyes points out that some Maya cities survived the same droughts that destroyed others, suggesting that political fragmentation, warfare between city-states, and the breakdown of trade networks made certain cities vulnerable to environmental shocks that more resilient communities weathered successfully.",
    stem: "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Reyes most likely respond to Dr. Yamamoto's argument?",
    choices: ["By agreeing that drought was the sole cause of the Maya collapse", "By arguing that drought played no role in the Maya collapse", "By contending that drought was a contributing factor but that political and economic fragility determined which communities collapsed", "By suggesting that the Maya civilization did not actually collapse"],
    answer: 2,
    explain: `Reyes "acknowledges the role of drought" (doesn't reject it) but says "alone cannot explain" because some cities survived the same droughts. The KEY variable is political/economic resilience. C captures this: drought contributed, but vulnerability determined outcomes.`

  {
    id: 13,
    type: "purpose",
    passage: "In 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball's color barrier, he was not the best player in the Negro Leagues — that distinction belonged to Josh Gibson, whose career statistics rivaled Babe Ruth's. Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers executive who recruited Robinson, chose him not for his athletic superiority but for his temperament: Robinson's ability to endure abuse without retaliating, Rickey calculated, would prove to white audiences that integration could work.",
    stem: "Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
    choices: ["To argue that Josh Gibson was better than Jackie Robinson", "To reveal that Robinson's selection was based on strategic temperament rather than pure athletic merit", "To criticize Branch Rickey's decision-making process", "To describe the history of the Negro Leagues"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The passage contrasts athletic ability (Gibson was better) with the actual selection criterion (Robinson's temperament). The purpose is to reveal the strategic REASONING behind the choice — not talent but the ability to endure abuse."
  },
  // BLOCK 4: INFORMATION & IDEAS (Q14-20)
  {
    id: 14,
    type: "central",
    passage: "The concept of 'rewilding' — reintroducing predators and other keystone species to ecosystems from which they've been eliminated — has gained momentum as a conservation strategy. In Yellowstone, the 1995 reintroduction of wolves triggered a 'trophic cascade': wolves reduced elk populations, which allowed overgrazed riverbank vegetation to recover, which stabilized stream banks, which altered the physical course of rivers. This single intervention reshaped an entire landscape, suggesting that rewilding can restore not just individual species but the complex ecological processes that sustain biodiversity.",
    stem: "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    choices: ["Wolves are the most important predator in North American ecosystems", "The Yellowstone wolf reintroduction demonstrates that restoring keystone species can regenerate entire ecosystems through cascading ecological effects", "Elk populations in Yellowstone were too large before wolves were reintroduced", "Rewilding is controversial among conservationists"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The passage describes rewilding concept → Yellowstone example (wolves → elk → vegetation → rivers) → broader principle (restoring processes, not just species). B captures both the specific example and the broader implication."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    type: "inference",
    passage: "A study of 1,000 startup companies found that those founded by individuals over 45 had a 2.3 times higher success rate than those founded by individuals under 30. The researchers noted that older founders typically had deeper industry knowledge, larger professional networks, and more management experience. Interestingly, venture capital firms allocated 72% of their funding to founders under 35.",
    stem: "Which inference is best supported by the text?",
    choices: ["Venture capital firms are investing optimally by focusing on young founders", "There appears to be a significant misalignment between where venture capital is allocated and where founder success is most likely, suggesting age bias may influence investment decisions", "Older people are better at everything than younger people", "The study proves that age causes startup success"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "Higher success for 45+ founders BUT 72% of VC money goes to under-35 founders = investment patterns don't match success patterns. B captures this misalignment and suggests bias as a possible explanation, without overstating."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    type: "evidence",
    passage: "Urban planner Dr. Santos argues that mixed-use zoning — allowing residential, commercial, and office space in the same neighborhoods — reduces car dependency more effectively than dedicated bike lanes or public transit alone.",
    claim: "Dr. Santos argues that mixed-use development addresses the root cause of car dependency rather than just its symptoms.",
    stem: "Which finding would most effectively support this claim?",
    choices: ["Mixed-use zoning has been adopted by several progressive cities", "A study of 50 cities found that residents of mixed-use neighborhoods made 40% fewer car trips than residents of single-use neighborhoods, regardless of the availability of bike lanes or transit — because daily needs like groceries, workplaces, and schools were within walking distance", "Dr. Santos has studied urban planning for over 20 years", "Some residents prefer living in single-use residential neighborhoods"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "The claim is about ROOT CAUSE (distance between destinations) vs. symptoms (how people travel). B shows that in mixed-use areas, car trips dropped 40% REGARDLESS of transit/bike availability — because destinations were walkable. This demonstrates that proximity, not transit, is the fundamental factor."

    id: 17,
    type: "data",
    passage: "Researchers studied the impact of different teaching methods on long-term retention of science concepts.",

      ["Project-based", "71%", "69%", "61%"]
    ],
    tableNote: "Scores as percentage of concepts correctly recalled.",
    stem: "Which claim is best supported by the data in the table?",
    choices: ["Lecture is the most effective teaching method because it produces the highest immediate test scores", "Methods with higher initial scores do not necessarily produce better long-term retention; in fact, project-based learning, which had the lowest immediate scores, showed the highest retention at six months", "Hands-on lab activities are always superior to lecture-based instruction", "All teaching methods produce identical results over time"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "Lecture: highest immediate (78%) but lowest 6-month (18%). Project-based: lowest immediate (71%) but highest 6-month (61%). B accurately captures this inverse relationship between initial performance and long-term retention."

    passage: "Neuroscientist Dr. Park proposes that bilingual individuals may have a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease because constantly managing two language systems strengthens the brain's executive control networks, building 'cognitive reserve' that delays the onset of symptoms.",
    stem: "Which finding, if true, would most strengthen Dr. Park's proposal?",
    choices: ["Bilingual individuals tend to have higher incomes than monolingual individuals", "Brain imaging studies show that bilingual individuals who developed Alzheimer's had significantly more physical brain deterioration at the time of diagnosis than monolingual patients with equivalent symptoms — suggesting the bilingual brain tolerates more damage before symptoms appear", "Many bilingual individuals learned their second language in childhood", "Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people worldwide"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `The proposal is about "cognitive reserve" (brain tolerates more damage). B provides direct evidence: bilingual Alzheimer's patients had MORE brain damage but EQUIVALENT symptoms — meaning their brains compensated longer. This is literally cognitive reserve in action.`

    passage: "A study of emergency room visits found that patients who arrived during the day shift (7 AM-3 PM) waited an average of 45 minutes, those arriving during the evening shift (3 PM-11 PM) waited 78 minutes, and those arriving during the overnight shift (11 PM-7 AM) waited just 22 minutes. However, the study also found that patients treated during the overnight shift had a 23% higher rate of misdiagnosis than those treated during the day shift. The researchers concluded that ______",
    stem: "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    choices: ["overnight emergency care is superior to daytime care in all respects", "shorter wait times during overnight shifts may come at the cost of diagnostic accuracy, possibly due to reduced staffing, physician fatigue, or limited access to specialist consultations", "patients should always visit the emergency room during the day shift", "wait times have no relationship to the quality of medical care"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: "Shortest wait (overnight) + highest misdiagnosis (overnight) = speed-quality tradeoff. B captures this and offers plausible explanations (fatigue, staffing, specialists) without overstating. A contradicts the data. C overgeneralizes. D is contradicted."

    passage: "The village of Eyam in Derbyshire, England, is known as the 'Plague Village' for a remarkable act of collective sacrifice during the 1665 bubonic plague. When the disease arrived via a flea-infested cloth shipment from London, the village's rector, William Mompesson, persuaded residents to quarantine the entire village — sealing themselves in to prevent the plague from spreading to neighboring communities. By the time the plague subsided fourteen months later, 260 of Eyam's 350 residents had died, but the surrounding villages were spared.",
    stem: "Which inference is best supported by the text?",
    choices: ["William Mompesson was the most important person in English history", "The residents of Eyam chose to accept a high probability of their own deaths in order to protect the wider community, demonstrating an extraordinary form of communal altruism", "The bubonic plague was caused by contaminated cloth", "All English villages during the 1665 plague enacted similar quarantines"],
    answer: 1,
    explain: `350 residents sealed themselves in knowing plague was present → 260 died → surrounding villages spared. They knowingly accepted extreme personal risk for collective benefit. B captures this altruistic sacrifice. C oversimplifies (flea-infested cloth). D isn't supported ("remarkable" implies unusual).`
