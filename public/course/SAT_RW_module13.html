Which choice most effectively achieves this goal?", choices: ["Bednorz and Müller discovered ceramic superconductors in 1986 and won the Nobel Prize the following year.", "By raising the superconducting threshold above 23K to 35K, Bednorz and Müller enabled the use of liquid nitrogen — a coolant roughly fifty times cheaper than the liquid helium previously required — making superconductor research accessible to laboratories worldwide.", "High-temperature superconductors are ceramic compounds that conduct electricity with zero resistance.", "The Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded annually to scientists who make important discoveries."], answer: 1, explain: "The goal asks about practical revolution. B connects the temperature increase directly to its practical impact: switching from expensive helium to cheap nitrogen, making research widely accessible. A mentions the Nobel but not why it was practical. C defines but doesn't explain significance. D is irrelevant." },

Sentence 2: personal flaws cut career short. This is a contrast between professional genius and personal destruction. 'However' signals this pivot from positive to negative." },

C explicitly names three distinct strategies and frames them as individual variation, directly emphasizing the diversity. A is too vague. B is generic. D mentions speed, not approach diversity." },

Which choice most effectively achieves this goal?", choices: ["Green roofs are vegetated systems installed on building rooftops that can reduce surface temperatures.", "Cities are significantly warmer than rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect.", "While green roofs are often framed as an environmental feature, Chicago's data demonstrates their direct public health impact: neighborhoods exceeding 30% green roof coverage experienced measurably fewer heat-related emergency room visits, suggesting that rooftop vegetation functions as preventive healthcare infrastructure.", "Dark rooftops can reach extremely high temperatures during summer, which is a problem for urban areas."], answer: 2, explain: "The goal is about reframing green roofs as health interventions. C does exactly this: it acknowledges the environmental framing, then pivots to Chicago's health data, and explicitly relabels them as 'preventive healthcare infrastructure.' A/B/D describe facts but don't make the health argument." },
  { id: "c5", type: "transition", sentence1: "Early astronomers assumed that the universe was static and eternal — a view so deeply held that even Einstein modified his equations with a 'cosmological constant' to prevent his theory from predicting an expanding universe.", sentence2: "_________, when Edwin Hubble demonstrated in 1929 that galaxies are moving apart, Einstein reportedly called his cosmological constant 'the biggest blunder' of his career.", stem: "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", choices: ["Similarly", "Consequently", "For instance", "Nevertheless"], answer: 1, explain: "Sentence 1: Einstein went to great lengths to maintain a static universe model. Sentence 2: Hubble proved the universe IS expanding, so Einstein's effort was wasted. 'Consequently' shows the causal chain: Hubble's proof resulted in Einstein admitting his error." },

C directly contrasts these: 'not that debaters argued more effectively, but that they revised their own positions.'
